# unsupervised_mid_semester
Mid semester and Final assignments - Unsupervised learning - Clustering comparison

This assignment consists of a comparison between clustering algorithms, namely K-means,
Fuzzy C Means, Gaussian Mixture, Hierarchical and Spectral clustering with anomaly detection using DBSCAN and Isolation Forest.
The dimension reduction are done with PCA, KernelPCA and T-SNE.
Comparison between clustering is computed via ANOVA and T-tests.
Performance are measured with silhouette score, Fowlkes-Mallow index, and Mutual Information.

The main results are described in the pdf files with their respective Supplemental Material.
